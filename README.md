## This repository contains materials in Introduction to Computation (B) (i.e., CS101) at Peking University.
#### Author: Xu Han; Course Instructor: Prof. Hongfei Yan.

- **Assignments**: weekly assignments and summary of learning;
- **Cheat_sheet**: a revised version of cheat sheet that I used in preparation for the computer test (which might also be a great material to quickly review the grammar and algorithms that this lecture includes);
- **Written_exam**: an annotated version of the written exams in the last few years (suitable to quickly grasp principles of computer science but orientated for the exam style in PKU, which still needs to be transferred from the handwritten version);
- **AssignmentP**: the final assignment helping us build this Github repository.
